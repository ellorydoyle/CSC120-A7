Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- I chose to overload the constructors for each of the subclasses, and I made it so you could input just the name, or the name and address of each building, because if you have never visited it, you may not know if it has a dining hall, an elevator, or even how many floors it has 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- I feel like I gave myself a good basis to work off of last week, so this week was simple. My advice is to triple check your barebones code before you implement more methods.
